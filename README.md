## Does this plant have a disease? (Challenge 6 (HARD))
Description of the challenge
Difficulty : HARD

Plant pathology is the scientific study of diseases in plants caused by pathogens and environmental conditions. Plant diseases are a normal part of nature and one of many ecological factors that help keep the hundreds of thousands of living plants and animals in balance with one another. However, when tardily detected, and subsequently left untreated, they can be the cause of loss of crops for example. Plant disease may also result in hunger and starvation, especially in less-developed countries where access to disease-control methods is limited and annual losses of 30 to 50 percent are not uncommon for major crops.

For this challenge you can use any library you want.

The provided dataset contains images in 15 differents classes, which are:
['Pepper bell Bacterial spot', 'Pepper bell healthy', 'Potato Early blight', 'Potato Late_blight', 'Potato healthy', 'Tomato Bacterial spot', 'Tomato Early blight', 'Tomato Late blight', 'Tomato Leaf Mold', 'Tomato Septoria leaf spot', 'Tomato Spider mites Two spotted spider mite', 'Tomato TargetSpot', 'Tomato Tomato YellowLeaf Curl Virus', 'Tomato Tomato mosaic virus', 'Tomato healthy']

Given an image, your job is to predict which type of plant it is and if it is healthy or which type of disease it has.
